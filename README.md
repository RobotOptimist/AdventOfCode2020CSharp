Solutions for [Advent of Code (AoC) 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in C# using [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive).

## Learning goals

My learning goals for this year's AoC is to become more fluent in C# and to learn how to apply object-oriented design principles to problem solving. I am currently learning about [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) as described in the popular book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by Erich Gamma, et al., aka the Gang of Four (GoF).

I aim to implement at least one of the following design patterns in creating the solution for each day's challenge:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Creational</th>
            <th>Structural</th>
            <th>Behavioral</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>Builder</li>
                    <li>Factory method</li>
                    <li>Abstract factory</li>
                    <li>Prototype</li>
                    <li>Singleton</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adapter</li>
                    <li>Bridge</li>
                    <li>Composite</li>
                    <li>Decorator</li>
                    <li>Facade</li>
                    <li>Flyweight</li>
                    <li>Proxy</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chain of responsibility</li>
                    <li>Command</li>
                    <li>Interpreter</li>
                    <li>Interator</li>
                    <li>Mediator</li>
                    <li>Memento</li>
                    <li>Null object</li>
                    <li>Observer</li>
                    <li>State</li>
                    <li>Strategy</li>
                    <li>Template method</li>
                    <li>Visitor</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

This may require my solutions to be verbose: setting up a lot of classes and interfaces when the problem could potentially be solved in fewer lines of code. I am not optimizing for brevity or for performance. Instead, I'll be looking for ways to apply my learning of design patterns to these challenges.

## Feedback

I will happily accept any feedback regarding my solutions! As I am new to these design patterns, any suggestions in applying them would be much appreciated!
